# Renterra - Take Home exercise

Thanks for taking the time to complete our take home exercise.

We appreciate you taking the time to complete this, but also want to
respect your personal time and ask that you spend no more then _2
hours_ on the project. We don't need to see a complete solution, but
be sure to `commit` your work as we care mostly about how you think
through the process.


## Process

  1. You've downloaded and unzipped the take-home.

  2. Initialize a git repository (use your name as a branch) - `git init --initial-branch=myname`

  3. Add and commit the files included in the zip

  4. See the [requirements](#requirements) below and then complete the exercise in your language of choice (You'll find another README inside each language directory)

  5. Bundle the repository and send to back to us! (`git bundle create repo.bundle -all`)


## Requirements

You'll want to look at the ["requirements"](requirements.txt) which
explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also
need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code
while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to
identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a
popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and
improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea
is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice
designing tests, taking small steps, running the tests often, and
incrementally improving the design.
